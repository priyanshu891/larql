//! State handles — opaque references to per-layer state rows and slabs
//! that may live on different devices or remote nodes.
//!
//! **Status:** 📝 Trait surface draft for W10 Phase A (2026-05-18).
//! No implementations yet — this file defines the API contract that
//! `larql-compute`'s CPU backend, `larql-compute-metal`'s GPU backend,
//! and a future `larql-compute-grid` remote backend will satisfy.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Today's hot path on Metal moves per-layer `(h_in, k_new, v_new)`
//! GPU → CPU every decode step:
//!
//! 1. Metal kernel writes the rows to staging buffers (W7 blit fusion
//!    inside one command buffer).
//! 2. `decode_token_with_state_dump` drains, reads back into
//!    `Vec<Vec<f32>>` (`DecodeStateDump`).
//! 3. `coarse_decode_step_with_state` wraps each `Vec<f32>` as
//!    `Array2::from_shape_vec((1, dim), vec)` into `PerLayerDecodeState`.
//! 4. Engine's `decode_step_via_dispatch` calls `append_row` to fold
//!    each row into `rs.stored[layer]` and `rs.hot_kv[layer]`.
//!
//! Steps 2–4 are eager — they pay readback + wrap + memcpy whether or
//! not the engine ever reads the row before window-clip. The handle
//! abstraction defers materialisation until a consumer actually needs
//! bytes on the local CPU.
//!
//! The same shape composes with two future deployments:
//!
//! - **Layer-sharded grid** (`larql-grid`): a row produced on node A
//!   for layer L can stay on node A; the engine sees a
//!   `RemoteStateHandle` and only fetches when this node needs to read.
//! - **Remote FFN** (`--ffn http://...`): residuals can stay on the
//!   FFN node across multiple layers; the engine's slab holds a
//!   `RemoteSlabHandle` for those layers.
//!
//! ## Composition with StatePolicy
//!
//! See `crates/larql-kv/docs/state-policy.md`. Each engine declares
//! whether a slab holds **canonical** state (defines the continuation
//! point — `materialise()` must round-trip losslessly) or
//! **derivative** state (a cache the engine can rebuild from canonical
//! — `materialise()` MAY recompute from canonical). The role tag
//! lives on the slab, not on individual rows: rows are just data, the
//! slab knows what kind of state it represents.
//!
//! This prevents the **PCA-90 inversion** class of bug — "refresh
//! derivative more often" is a free knob; "refresh canonical more
//! often" is state intervention — at the API boundary, instead of
//! relying on convention.
//!
//! ## Composition with LayerEngine
//!
//! See `crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/layer-engine.md`. The
//! handle surface lives *below* LayerEngine — each `KvEngine_L` still
//! owns its own slabs at its layer; LayerEngine just chooses which
//! engine runs where. Two composition points matter:
//!
//! - **[`SlabRole`] is the static kind; LayerEngine's §4.2 skip rule
//!   is the dynamic query.** A `Derivative` tag is necessary for a
//!   LayerEngine to elide a K/V append at L, but not sufficient: the
//!   engine's own State Policy must also report
//!   `permits_no_append_at(L)` for that decode step. The two
//!   compose; this trait surface answers the static half.
//! - **[`RowLocation`] is what LayerEngine's §6.2 backend refusal
//!   reads.** A LayerEngine with heterogeneous slab locations (e.g.
//!   `L0–12 = CompiledLookup` on a cache server, `L13+ =
//!   MarkovResidual` on a GPU node) is enumerable through this enum;
//!   backends decline LayerEngines whose location set they can't
//!   serve at construction, not silently mid-decode.

///
/// - **Canonical**: discarding it loses the conversation. Examples:
///   `MarkovResidualEngine`'s residual stream, `TurboQuantEngine`'s
///   compressed K/V (destructive), `StandardEngine`'s K/V tensors,

///   change — bumps `exact_logits` to `bounded_KL(ε)` — and requires

///   discard the cached bytes and ask the engine to re-project.

/// **Shape duality.** [`PerLayerDecodeState`](crate::PerLayerDecodeState)

/// `[1, dim]`). The handle reports its actual shape via
/// [`shape`](Self::shape); engines must not assume single-row.
///
/// `StateHandle` is one trait for all three slot kinds because the
/// materialisation semantics are identical; the semantic identity
/// ("this is K vs V vs h_in") is fixed by which field of

/// - [`into_array`](Self::into_array) is the consuming variant. On
///   local-CPU handles it moves the internal `Array2` out without a
///   copy (this is the W10 invariant that keeps CPU hot path at
///   today's allocation count). On non-local handles it materialises
///   then yields.

///

/// as the rows it holds. Heterogeneous slabs (rows from different
/// devices) are an extension point: today the trait assumes one
/// location per slab.
///
/// ## Append contract
///
/// [`append`](Self::append) consumes a `Box<dyn StateHandle>`. The
/// slab is free to:
///
/// - Move the row's bytes into its growing buffer (CPU happy path).
/// - Inspect the row's location and skip the copy when the row
///   already lives in the slab's storage (Metal happy path — the
///   kernel wrote into the kv cache, the slab IS the kv cache, so
///   append is a length bump).
/// - Materialise + copy (cross-device fallback).
///
/// The `dim` of the appended row MUST match the slab's row dim. Slab
/// implementations may assert this.
