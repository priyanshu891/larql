//! `AsyncComputeBackend` — deferred-dispatch sibling to [`KvDispatch`].
//!
//! See `docs/specs/async-compute-backend.md` for the full design.
//!
//! ## Why a separate trait
//!
//! [`KvDispatch`] is synchronous: every intent commits + waits on the GPU
//! (or completes on the CPU) before returning. That shape is correct but
//! defeats command-buffer batching on Metal / Vulkan / CUDA — one sync
//! per per-layer intent is orders of magnitude slower than today's fused
//! `decode_token` path. `AsyncComputeBackend` lets backends *accumulate*
//! per-layer intents into one in-flight command buffer per decode session
//! and only block on read-back. Engines opt in by constructing themselves
//! with an [`AsyncComputeBackend`] (e.g. `StandardEngine::with_async_backend`).
//!
//! Both traits coexist permanently. `AsyncComputeBackend` is the
//! performance path; [`KvDispatch`] stays the correctness reference.
//!
//! ## Handle ownership: spec deviation
//!
//! The spec sketches `Arc<dyn AsyncHandleInner<Output = T>>` with
//! `read(self: Arc<Self>)`. On stable Rust that combination requires
//! `#![feature(arbitrary_self_types)]`. The stable-Rust translation
//! adopted here is one inner trait per handle type with
//! `read(self: Box<Self>) -> Output`, which is object-safe and consumes
//! the handle on read exactly as the spec intends. The spec's
//! idempotency requirement ("calling `read` on a handle whose backend
//! has already committed returns immediately") survives unchanged —
//! backends record commit state on shared interior state, not on the
//! handle.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! - [`mod@self`] (this file) — trait surface, handle types, `Ready*`
//!   helpers, error type.
//! - [`cpu`] — `CpuBackend` async impl (degenerate `Ready*` wrapper,
//!   parity reference).
//! - [`metal`] — `MetalBackend` async scaffold (feature-gated behind
//!   `metal`; A3 delegates to CPU at present, real deferred dispatch
//!   lands in A4).
//! - Future siblings: `vulkan`, `cuda` (per spec §7.2, §7.3).
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Step A1 of the migration: trait + handle types + `Ready*` helpers.
//! A2 (`CpuBackend`) and A3 (`MetalBackend`) scaffolding shipped
//! 2026-05-16 — see the spec's migration plan §10 for the full
//! sequencing.
