//! `Capability` — what a backend says it can accelerate.
//!
//! `ComputeBackend` exposes many `Option<…>`-returning methods; each
//! is a "try and see" capability probe. That's awkward because callers
//! have to call the method, check for `None`, and fall back. The
//! [`Capability`] enum lets the caller branch *before* the call:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if backend.supports(Capability::F32Gemv) {
//!     backend.f32_gemv(w, x).unwrap()
//! } else {
//!     backend.matmul_transb(q_row, w).row(0).to_vec()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A backend lists what it can do via [`crate::ComputeBackend::supports`].
//! Default impl returns `false` for everything; override to enable.

/// What a backend can accelerate. Independent flags — a backend
/// typically says yes to several.
