//! Per-stage decode timing — the shape that replaces the deleted
//! `decode_profile.rs` duplicate.
//!
//! This module ships the **public API** ([`ProfileTimings`] +
//! [`MetalBackend::decode_token_with_profile`]) so that callers
//! (notably `larql-inference::layer_graph::generate` under
//! `LARQL_PROFILE_SPLIT=1`) can request per-stage timing without
//! a parallel decode path.
//!
//! Implementation (2026-05-02): when `LARQL_PROFILE_SPLIT=1` (or
//! `LARQL_DECODE_STAGE_TIMING=1`) is set, `decode_token_with_moe_split_fn`
//! inserts paired commit/wait boundaries between the attention block and
//! the FFN block on every layer. The resulting per-stage GPU times land
//! in a thread-local cell so [`MetalBackend::decode_token_split_profile`]
//! can read them back.
//!
//! Granularity today is **attention vs full FFN block**:
//! - `attn_ms` — Steps 1.5–5: QK-norm + RoPE + V-norm + KV append/attend
//!   + O proj + post-attn residual + ffn-input norm.
//! - `gate_up_ms` — the **entire FFN block**: gate + up + activation
//!   (GEGLU/SiLU) + down + post-FFN residual.
//! - `down_ms` — **0 for now**, reserved for the next-finer split that
//!   breaks `encode_ffn_step` into `gate_up` and `down` phases.
//!
//! Cost: ~2 commit/waits per layer × 34 = ~68/token of cmd-buffer
//! overhead (~2–3 ms on M3 Max). This is measurement-only mode; the
//! production decode path is unchanged when the env var is unset.
